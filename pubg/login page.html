      <p> <h4>
        UBG Mobile features gameplay similar to that of the original
        PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds. Players parachute down to a remote island
        and fight to remain as the last player standing, competing alone or in
        teams of two or four, depending on the gamemode selected before the
        match. Each match lasts about 30 minutes. The game begins with the
        participants flying in a plane over one of many possible maps, also
        selected before the match. As they cross the map, players choose where
        to parachute down. When the plane finishes its flight, a blue border
        forms around the perimeter of the island, marking the boundary between
        the safe zone and the exterior blue zone. The safe zone shrinks every
        few minutes, and anyone left in the blue zone will steadily lose health
        as long as they remain there, potentially to the point of death. The
        rate of health loss increases when the safe zone shrinks. When players
        first reach the island with no supplies or weapons and must find them
        around their environment or from other players. In general, better
        weapons and equipment are found in more dangerous parts of the map.[6]
        In addition to the regular shrinking of the safe zone, temporary red
        zones may randomly appear to be barraged with bombs, and from time to
        time, the plane flies over the battlefield to release a package with
        special equipment, potentially including items that cannot be found
        elsewhere on the island. All of these special events, including the
        normal safe zone shrinking, are announced to the players before they
        occur to give fair warning.[7][8] Additional features unique to the
        mobile version of PUBG include log-in bonuses, missions and micro-goals,
        crew recruiting, map and compass improvements with larger and clear
        markers near the teammates, and an auto loot system, as well as an
        increased number of bots.[9][10]
